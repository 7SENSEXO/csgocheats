# sdk

I've been developing an SDK foundation that was initially intended for personal use and as a means to refine my skills. Unfortunately, my hard drive repeatedly suffered from corruption issues while storing the SDK. Consequently, I opted to upload it here, enabling me to download it whenever I need it without concerns about corruption. Feel free to utilize it if you find it helpful; though, this project primarily serves as a secure repository for my personal use.
